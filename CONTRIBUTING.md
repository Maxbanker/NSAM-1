# Contributing to NSAM-1

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please keep in mind this is **simulation-only** research code.

## Getting started
- Open an issue to discuss significant changes.
- Use a feature branch and open a PR when ready.
- Add tests where reasonable (even minimal smoke tests).

## Code style
- Python 3.10+
- Keep the demo deterministic; seed RNGs if you add any.
- Prefer small, auditable changes with good docstrings.

## Safety & ethics
- Never upload proprietary or plant-specific data.
- Make sure docs and commits clearly indicate simulation-only usage.
